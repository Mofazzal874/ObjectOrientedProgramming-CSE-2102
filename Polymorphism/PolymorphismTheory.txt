//Polymorphism in c++ is of two types:
//1. Compile time polymorphism
//2. Run time polymorphism
//Compile time polymorphism is further divided into two types:
//1. Static binding
//2. Dynamic binding
//Static binding is further divided into two types:
//1. Function overloading
//2. Operator overloading
//Dynamic binding is further divided into two types:
//1. Function overriding
//2. Virtual functions
//Static binding is also called early binding
//Dynamic binding is also called late binding
//Static binding: Compiler knows how many objects and functions should be created.
//Dynamic binding: Compiler doesn't know , we will say that in the runtime of the programme
